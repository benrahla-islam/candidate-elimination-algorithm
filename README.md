5. **View Results**: See the Final S and Final G hypotheses in the Results tab

## Data Format

Your CSV file should:
- Have headers in the first row
- Include all feature columns followed by the target column (last column)
- Use consistent values for positive/negative cases (e.g., "Yes"/"No", "True"/"False")

## Sample Data

The application includes sample CSV files in the `sample_data` folder:
- `data.csv` - Basic example dataset
- `driving_behavior.csv` - Driving behavior classification
- `test_data.csv` - Additional test data

## Troubleshooting

**Python Not Found**: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed and added to your system PATH.

**Missing Dependencies**: The application will automatically install required packages (pandas, tkinter).

**CSV Import Issues**: Verify your CSV file has proper formatting and encoding (UTF-8 recommended).
